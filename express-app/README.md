# Streaming Availability App

## Features

Users will be able to search movie or show names (case insensitive) and see what streaming services the piece of media is available on.

## TODO/POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS

Some things I would add/I think would be nice to have if given more time and resources:
- Autocomplete
  - This API has an autocomplete that I would like to explore
- Error handling
- More account features
  - Watch list that recommends streaming service based on added shows/movies
